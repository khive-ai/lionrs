## Abstract

This chapter establishes the theoretical foundations for isolation and
concurrency in the Lion ecosystem through formal verification of two fundamental
theorems. We prove complete memory isolation between plugins using WebAssembly's
linear memory model extended with Iris-Wasm separation logic, and demonstrate
deadlock-free execution through a hierarchical actor model with supervision.

**Key Contributions**:

1. **WebAssembly Isolation Theorem**: Complete memory isolation between plugins
   and host environment
2. **Deadlock Freedom Theorem**: Guaranteed progress in concurrent execution
   under actor model
3. **Separation Logic Foundations**: Formal invariants using Iris-Wasm for
   memory safety
4. **Hierarchical Actor Model**: Supervision-based concurrency with formal
   deadlock prevention
5. **Mechanized Verification**: Lean4 proofs for both isolation and deadlock
   freedom properties

**Theorems Proven**:

- **Theorem 3.1 (WebAssembly Isolation)**:
  $$\forall i, j \in \text{Plugin\_IDs}, i \neq j: \{P[i].\text{memory}\} * \{P[j].\text{memory}\} * \{\text{Host}.\text{memory}\}$$
- **Theorem 3.2 (Deadlock Freedom)**: Lion actor concurrency model guarantees
  deadlock-free execution

**Implementation Significance**:

- Enables secure plugin architectures with mathematical guarantees
- Provides concurrent execution with bounded performance overhead
- Establishes foundation for distributed Lion ecosystem deployment
- Combines isolation and concurrency for secure concurrent execution
