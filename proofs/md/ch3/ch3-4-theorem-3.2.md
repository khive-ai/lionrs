**Theorem 3.2** (Deadlock Freedom): The Lion actor concurrency model guarantees
deadlock-free execution in the Lion ecosystem's concurrent plugins and services.

This theorem asserts that under Lion's scheduling and supervision rules, the
system will never enter a global deadlock state (where each actor is waiting for
a message that never comes, forming a cycle of waiting).

## 3.4.1 Understanding Deadlocks in Actors

In an actor model, a deadlock would typically manifest as a cycle of actors each
waiting for a response from another. For example, $A$ is waiting for a message
from $B$, $B$ from $C$, and $C$ from $A$. However, because our actors do not
have blocking receive calls (they just process messages as they come) and
because any "waiting" is implemented by continuing to run but not finding the
expected message yet, the usual notion of deadlock is slightly different. It
would mean that a set of actors is in a state where they will not process any
new messages because each is internally "stuck" expecting a condition that
depends on the others (logical deadlock rather than literal thread lock).

Lion's approach to preventing this is twofold: **non-blocking design** and
**supervision**. Non-blocking means an actor does not pause its thread
indefinitely; it might, for example, send a request and then continue to process
other messages (or at least yield to the scheduler). Supervision means if an
actor does become unresponsive or stuck, another actor (its supervisor) can
restart or stop it.

## 3.4.2 Proof Strategy for Deadlock Freedom

We will formalize deadlock as a state where no actor can make progress, yet not
all actors have completed their work (some are waiting on something). Then we
show by induction on the length of execution that reaching such a state is
impossible.

Our mechanized Lean model (Appendix B.2) provides a framework for this proof:

- We define a predicate $\text{has\_deadlock}(\text{sys})$ that is true if
  there's a cycle in the "wait-for" graph of the actor system state $\text{sys}$
  (i.e., a circular dependency of waiting)
- We prove two crucial lemmas about the actor system using Lean:

  - **supervision_breaks_cycles**: If the supervision hierarchy is acyclic (no
    actor ultimately supervises itself, which we ensure by design) and if every
    waiting actor has a supervisor that is not waiting (supervisors monitor
    lower actors and do not all get stuck together), then any wait-for cycle
    must be broken by a supervisor's ability to intervene
  - **system_progress**: If no actor is currently processing a message (i.e.,
    all are idle or waiting), the scheduler can always find an actor to deliver
    a message to, unless there are no messages at all (in which case the system
    is quiescent, not deadlocked)

Using these, the Lean proof of `c2_deadlock_freedom` proceeds to show that under
the assumptions of proper supervision (`h_intervention`) and fair message
delivery (`h_progress`), $\text{has\_deadlock}(\text{sys})$ can never be true.
Intuitively, either there is a pending message to deliver (so someone can run),
or a supervisor will kick in to handle a stuck actor.

## 3.4.3 Key Intuition and Steps

### 1. Absence of Wait Cycles

Suppose for contradiction there is a cycle of actors each waiting for a message
from the next. Consider the one that is highest in the supervision hierarchy.
Its supervisor sees that it's waiting and can send it a nudge or restart it
(Lion's supervisors could implement a timeout or health check). That action
either breaks the wait (gives it a message or resets its state) or removes it
from the cycle (if restarted, it's no longer waiting for the old message). This
effectively breaks the cycle. The formal property is that in any cycle, at least
one actor has a supervisor outside the cycle (since the hierarchy is a tree),
which can act.

### 2. Fair Scheduling

Even without cycles, could the system simply halt because, say, one actor is
waiting and others are idle? Fair scheduling (Progress lemma) says if actor $A$
is waiting for a response from $B$, either $B$ has sent it (then $A$'s message
will arrive), or $B$ hasn't yet, but $B$ will be scheduled to run and perhaps
produce it. If $B$ itself was waiting for something, follow the chain: fairness
ensures that if there's any message in any mailbox, it will eventually be
delivered to an actor that can handle it.

### 3. No Resource Deadlocks

We also ensure that resource locks are not a source of deadlock because Lion
doesn't use traditional locks. File handles and other resources are accessed via
capabilities asynchronously. There's no scenario of two actors each holding a
resource the other needs, because the act of waiting for a resource is turned
into waiting for a message (like waiting for a "file open granted" message from
the memory manager, which again falls under message waiting).

## Combining the Elements

Combining 1, 2, and 3, any potential deadlock is unraveled:

- If messages are outstanding, someone will process them
- If no messages are outstanding but actors are waiting, that implies a cycle of
  waiting (because if only one actor is waiting, the rest are idle â€“ that one
  waiting actor must be expecting from someone). But any such cycle is resolved
  by supervision
- The only remaining base case: no messages outstanding and all actors idle or
  completed = not a deadlock (that's normal termination or quiescence)

Thus, deadlock can't occur.

## 3.4.4 Conclusion

**Theorem 3.2** is proven by the above reasoning: the system cannot reach a
state of circular waiting due to the structure of actor interactions and the
supervision hierarchy. In practical terms, Lion's concurrency avoids global
deadlocks by design:

- Actors use **non-blocking message passing**, so they never hold on to each
  other in a way that causes mutual waiting
- **Supervisors** act as a safety net: if something ever were to stall, the
  supervisor would reset part of the system, breaking the stalemate
- The **scheduler's fairness** ensures no actor that could do work is left
  starving behind a busy actor; all get turns to progress their part

Finally, our mechanized proof in Lean (Appendix B.2) double-checks these
arguments, giving high assurance that the concurrency model is deadlock-free.
