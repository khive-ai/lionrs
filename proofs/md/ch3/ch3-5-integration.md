Having proven Theorem 3.1 (isolation) and Theorem 3.2 (deadlock freedom), we can
assert the following combined property for Lion's runtime:

**Secure Concurrency Property**: The system can execute untrusted plugin code in
parallel _securely_ (thanks to isolation) and _without deadlock_ (thanks to the
actor model). This means Lion achieves _secure concurrency_: multiple plugins
run concurrently but cannot compromise each other or the host, and they will
always continue to make progress.

## Formal Integration Statement

Let $\mathcal{S}$ be the Lion system state with plugins
$\{P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n\}$ executing concurrently. We have:

$$\text{Secure\_Concurrency}(\mathcal{S}) \triangleq \text{Isolation}(\mathcal{S}) \land \text{Deadlock\_Free}(\mathcal{S})$$

where:

- $\text{Isolation}(\mathcal{S}) \triangleq \forall i, j: i \neq j \Rightarrow \text{memory\_disjoint}(P_i, P_j) \land \text{capability\_confined}(P_i, P_j)$
- $\text{Deadlock\_Free}(\mathcal{S}) \triangleq \neg \text{has\_deadlock}(\mathcal{S})$

## Implementation Validation

This combined property has been validated through:

1. **Formal Proofs**: Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 provide mathematical guarantees
2. **Mechanized Verification**: Lean4 proofs encode and verify both properties
3. **Empirical Testing**: Small-scale test harness where multiple actors
   (plugins) communicate in patterns that would cause deadlock in lesser systems
   â€“ but in Lion, the system either completes normally or a supervisor
   gracefully recovers from an issue, with no global freeze

## Security and Performance Implications

**Security Benefits**:

- Untrusted code cannot escape its sandbox (isolation)
- Malicious plugins cannot cause system-wide denial of service through deadlock
  (deadlock freedom)
- Combined: attackers cannot use concurrency bugs to break isolation or vice
  versa

**Performance Benefits**:

- No lock contention (actor model eliminates traditional locks)
- Fair scheduling ensures predictable resource allocation
- Supervision overhead is minimal during normal operation
- Parallel execution with formal guarantees enables confident scaling

## Theoretical Foundation for Distribution

The combination of isolation and deadlock freedom establishes the theoretical
foundation for extending Lion to distributed environments:

- **Local correctness** is proven (this chapter)
- **Distributed consensus** can build on these local guarantees (future work)
- **Network partitions** cannot break isolation (each node maintains local
  isolation)
- **Distributed deadlock** can be prevented using similar supervision
  hierarchies across nodes
