## Abstract

This chapter establishes the mathematical foundations for policy evaluation and
workflow orchestration correctness in the Lion ecosystem. We prove policy
soundness through formal verification of evaluation algorithms and demonstrate
workflow termination guarantees through DAG-based execution models.

**Key Contributions**:

1. **Policy Soundness Theorem**: Formal proof that policy evaluation never
   grants unsafe permissions
2. **Workflow Termination Theorem**: Mathematical guarantee that all workflows
   complete in finite time
3. **Composition Algebra**: Complete algebraic framework for policy and workflow
   composition
4. **Complexity Analysis**: Polynomial-time bounds for all policy and workflow
   operations
5. **Capability Integration**: Unified authorization framework combining
   policies and capabilities

**Theorems Proven**:

- **Theorem 4.1 (Policy Soundness)**:
  $\forall p \in P, a \in A: \varphi(p, a) = \text{PERMIT} \Rightarrow \text{SAFE}(p, a)$
  with $O(d \times b)$ complexity
- **Theorem 4.2 (Workflow Termination)**: Every workflow execution in Lion
  terminates in finite time

**Mathematical Framework**:

- **Policy Evaluation Domain**: Three-valued logic system
  $\{\text{PERMIT}, \text{DENY}, \text{INDETERMINATE}\}$
- **Access Request Structure**:
  $(\text{subject}, \text{resource}, \text{action}, \text{context})$ tuples
- **Capability Structure**:
  $(\text{authority}, \text{permissions}, \text{constraints}, \text{delegation\_depth})$
  tuples
- **Workflow Model**: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with bounded retry policies

**Implementation Significance**:

- Enables confident deployment in production environments requiring correctness
  guarantees
- Provides polynomial complexity bounds ensuring practical performance
- Integrates seamlessly with capability-based security from Chapter 2
- Establishes foundation for enterprise-grade orchestration systems
