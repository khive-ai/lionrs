## Mathematical Content Overview

### Theorems Proven

- **Theorem 4.1** (Policy Soundness):
  $\forall p \in \mathbf{P}, a \in \mathbf{A}: \varphi(p, a) = \text{PERMIT} \Rightarrow \text{SAFE}(p, a)$
- **Theorem 4.2** (Workflow Termination): Every workflow execution terminates in
  finite time
- **Theorem 4.3** (Policy Closure): Composition operators preserve soundness
- **Theorem 4.4** (Functional Completeness): Policy language is complete for
  three-valued logic
- **Theorem 4.5** (Workflow Completeness): Workflow operators express all finite
  orchestration patterns
- **Theorem 4.6** (Policy Type Safety): Well-typed compositions produce
  well-typed policies
- **Theorem 4.7** (Workflow Type Safety): Compositions preserve task interface
  compatibility

### Key Definitions

- **Definition 4.1** (Policy Evaluation Domain): Three-valued logic system
- **Definition 4.2** (Access Request Structure): Request tuple format
- **Definition 4.3** (Capability Structure): Capability tuple with attenuation
- **Definition 4.4** (Policy Evaluation Function):
  $\varphi: \mathbf{P} \times \mathbf{A} \to \text{Decisions}$
- **Definition 4.5** (Capability Check Function):
  $\kappa: \mathbf{C} \times \mathbf{A} \to \{\text{TRUE}, \text{FALSE}\}$
- **Definition 4.6** (Combined Authorization):
  $\text{authorize}(p, c, a) = \varphi(p, a) \land \kappa(c, a)$
- **Definition 4.7** (Workflow Structure): DAG representation
  $(N, E, \text{start}, \text{end})$

### Formal Models

- **Policy Language Grammar**: Complete BNF with composition operators

  workflows
