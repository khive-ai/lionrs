## Workflow Representation and Execution

In Lion, workflows orchestrate multiple plugins or components into a sequence or
graph of tasks. Formally, a workflow can be seen as a directed acyclic graph
(DAG) of tasks, possibly with branching (for conditional logic) and joining
(waiting for multiple inputs).

### Definition 4.7: Workflow Structure

A workflow $W \in \mathbf{W}$ is defined as:

$$W = (N, E, \text{start}, \text{end})$$

where:

- $N$ is a set of nodes (tasks)
- $E \subseteq N \times N$ is a set of directed edges representing execution
  order and dependency
- $\text{start} \in N$ is the initial node
- $\text{end} \in N$ is the final node

Each edge $(u, v) \in E$ implies task $u$ must complete before task $v$ can
start.

### DAG Property

**Constraint**: All workflows must be directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), ensuring:

$$\nexists \text{ path } n_1 \to n_2 \to \ldots \to n_k \to n_1 \text{ where } k > 0$$

This property is crucial for termination guarantees.

### Task Structure

Each node $n \in N$ represents a task with the following properties:

$$\text{Task} = (\text{plugin\_id}, \text{input\_spec}, \text{output\_spec}, \text{retry\_policy})$$

where:

- $\text{plugin\_id}$ identifies the plugin to execute
- $\text{input\_spec}$ defines required inputs and their sources
- $\text{output\_spec}$ defines produced outputs and their destinations
- $\text{retry\_policy}$ specifies error handling behavior

## Error Handling Policies

Workflows include sophisticated error handling mechanisms that preserve
termination guarantees:

### Retry Policies

**Bounded Retries**: Each task has a finite retry limit:

$$\text{retry\_policy} = (\text{max\_attempts}, \text{backoff\_strategy}, \text{timeout})$$

where:

- $\text{max\_attempts} \in \mathbb{N}$ (finite)
- $\text{backoff\_strategy} \in \{\text{linear}, \text{exponential}, \text{constant}\}$
- $\text{timeout} \in \mathbb{R}^+$ (finite)

**Constraint**: All retry mechanisms must be finite to ensure termination.

### Failure Propagation

Failure handling strategies include:

1. **Fail-fast**: Immediate workflow termination on critical task failure
2. **Skip**: Continue workflow execution, marking task as skipped
3. **Alternative path**: Route to alternate execution branch
4. **Compensation**: Execute rollback/cleanup tasks

All strategies maintain the DAG property and finite execution guarantee.

## Concurrency in Workflows

Workflows support parallel execution through fork-join patterns:

### Parallel Branches

A node can have multiple outgoing edges, creating parallel execution:

$$\text{fork}: n \to \{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k\}$$

Each branch $n_i$ executes independently, subject to the same termination
guarantees.

### Join Operations

A join node waits for multiple incoming branches:

$$\text{join}: \{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k\} \to n$$

The join operation has configurable semantics:

- **All**: Wait for all branches to complete
- **Any**: Proceed when any branch completes
- **Majority**: Proceed when majority of branches complete
- **Timeout**: Proceed after specified time limit

## Resource Management

Workflow execution integrates with Lion's resource management:

### Resource Allocation

Each task specifies resource requirements:

$$\text{resources} = (\text{memory}, \text{cpu}, \text{storage}, \text{capabilities})$$

The workflow engine ensures resources are available before task execution.

### Resource Bounds

Workflow-level resource limits prevent resource exhaustion:

$$\text{workflow\_limits} = (\text{total\_memory}, \text{max\_duration}, \text{max\_tasks})$$

These limits contribute to termination guarantees by preventing unbounded
resource consumption.

## Scheduling Integration

Workflow execution leverages Lion's actor-based scheduling (Chapter 3):

### Task Scheduling

Each workflow task becomes an actor in the Lion system, inheriting:

- Deadlock-free execution guarantees (Theorem 3.2)
- Fair scheduling properties
- Supervision hierarchy for fault tolerance

### Message Passing

Task coordination uses the actor message passing model:

$$\text{task\_message} = (\text{sender\_task}, \text{receiver\_task}, \text{data}, \text{correlation\_id})$$

This ensures reliable communication between workflow tasks.

## Workflow Composition

Workflows can be composed hierarchically:

### Subworkflow Embedding

A task node can represent an entire subworkflow:

$$\text{composite\_task} = (\text{subworkflow\_id}, \text{input\_mapping}, \text{output\_mapping})$$

Subworkflows inherit the same termination guarantees as atomic tasks.

### Workflow Templates

Common workflow patterns can be parameterized:

$$\text{template} = (\text{pattern}, \text{parameters}, \text{instantiation\_rules})$$

Templates preserve correctness properties through formal instantiation rules.
