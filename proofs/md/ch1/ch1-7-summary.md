# 1.7 Chapter Summary

In this foundational chapter, we established the category-theoretic basis for
the Lion microkernel ecosystem:

- **LionComp Category**: A formal representation of system components and
  interactions, enabling reasoning about composition.
- **Security as Morphisms**: Key security invariants (authority confinement,
  isolation) are encoded as properties of morphisms and functors in LionComp.
- **Compositional Guarantees**: We proved that fundamental properties (like
  security invariants) are preserved under composition (both sequential and
  parallel) using categorical arguments.
- **Guidance for Design**: The categorical model directly informed the Lion
  system's API and type design, ensuring that many security guarantees are
  enforced by construction.

These foundations provide the mathematical framework for understanding and
verifying the Lion microkernel ecosystem. The next chapter will apply this
framework to the specific capability-based security mechanisms in Lion, using
the formal tools developed here to prove the system's security theorems.
