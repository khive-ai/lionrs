## Key Theoretical Results

1. **LionComp Category**: Formal category structure for Lion ecosystem with
   capability-mediated morphisms
2. **Security Composition Theorem**: Proof that security properties are
   preserved under parallel composition
3. **Categorical Design Correspondence**: Direct mapping from category theory to
   Rust implementation
4. **Functorial Security**: Natural transformations preserving security
   properties across system evolution

## Mathematical Framework

The chapter establishes:

- **Objects**: System components (Core, CapabilityManager, IsolationEnforcer,
  Plugins)
- **Morphisms**: Capability-mediated interactions with preconditions and
  postconditions
- **Composition**: Capability combination preserving security properties
- **Monoidal Structure**: Parallel composition with tensor product and braiding
- **Functors**: Capability, Isolation, and Policy functors connecting system
  aspects

This categorical foundation enables compositional reasoning about Lion's
security properties and provides the mathematical framework for the capability
security theorems presented in Chapter 2.
