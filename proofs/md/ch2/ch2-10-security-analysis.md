# 2.10 Security Analysis and Threat Model

## 2.10.1 Threat Model

The Lion capability system defends against a comprehensive threat model:

### Attacker Capabilities

- **Malicious Components**: Attacker controls one or more system components
- **Network Access**: Attacker can intercept and modify network communications
- **Side Channels**: Attacker can observe timing, power, or other side channels
- **Social Engineering**: Attacker can trick users into granting capabilities

### System Assumptions

- **Trusted Computing Base**: Lion core, isolation layer, and policy engine are
  trusted
- **Cryptographic Primitives**: HMAC, digital signatures, and random number
  generation are secure
- **WebAssembly Isolation**: WebAssembly provides memory safety and isolation
- **Hardware Security**: Underlying hardware provides basic security guarantees

## 2.10.2 Security Properties Verified

The theorems provide formal guarantees against specific attack classes:

### 1. Capability Forgery Attacks

- **Threat**: Attacker creates fake capabilities
- **Defense**: Theorem 2.1 proves capabilities are unforgeable
- **Mechanism**: Phantom types + WebAssembly isolation + HMAC signatures

### 2. Authority Amplification Attacks

- **Threat**: Attacker gains more authority than granted
- **Defense**: Theorem 2.4 proves automatic POLA enforcement
- **Mechanism**: Type system constraints + attenuation-only derivation

### 3. Confused Deputy Attacks

- **Threat**: Attacker tricks privileged component into unauthorized actions
- **Defense**: Theorem 2.3 proves confused deputy prevention
- **Mechanism**: No ambient authority + explicit capability passing

### 4. Composition Attacks

- **Threat**: Secure components become insecure when composed
- **Defense**: Theorem 2.2 proves compositional security
- **Mechanism**: Interface validation + policy enforcement

## 2.10.3 Security Property Analysis

The formal theorems provide verifiable guarantees against specific attack
vectors. The performance characteristics of these security mechanisms are
detailed in Section 2.11.3.

## 2.10.4 Implementation Correspondence

### Rust Implementation Architecture

The formal theorems directly correspond to the Lion Rust implementation:

```rust
// Phantom types prevent forgery at compile time
pub struct Capability<T, R> {
    _phantom: PhantomData<(T, R)>,
    inner: Arc<dyn CapabilityTrait>,
}

// WebAssembly isolation prevents forgery at runtime  
pub struct WasmCapabilityHandle {
    id: u64,        // Opaque handle
    signature: [u8; 32], // HMAC signature
}

// Type system enforces minimal authority
impl<T, R> Capability<T, R> {
    fn attenuate<S>(&self) -> Capability<T, S>
    where
        S: RightsSubset<R>  // Compile-time constraint
    {
        // Cannot amplify authority - only reduce
        Capability {
            _phantom: PhantomData,
            inner: self.inner.attenuate::<S>(),
        }
    }
}
```

### Performance Optimizations

- **Zero-Copy Capabilities**: Efficient capability passing without serialization
- **Type-Level Optimization**: Compile-time capability checking eliminates
  runtime overhead
- **HMAC Verification**: O(1) cryptographic verification with hardware
  acceleration

## 2.10.5 Scalability Analysis

The formal proofs scale to arbitrary system sizes:

- **Component Composition**: Security properties preserved under composition
  (Theorem 2.2)
- **Capability Propagation**: Authority bounds maintained across arbitrary
  delegation chains
- **Policy Enforcement**: Distributed policy validation maintains consistency
- **Cross-Component Communication**: Transfer protocol scales to large component
  graphs
