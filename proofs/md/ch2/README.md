# Chapter 2: Capability Security Framework

This chapter presents the formal verification of Lion's capability-based
security system through four fundamental theorems. The capability security
framework provides the mathematical foundation for secure component composition,
authority management, and access control in the Lion microkernel ecosystem.

## Summary

The capability security framework establishes Lion's theoretical foundation
through four proven theorems:

1. **Cross-Component Capability Flow** (2.1): Authority preservation and
   unforgeability
2. **Security Composition** (2.2): Secure component composition guarantees
3. **Confused Deputy Prevention** (2.3): Structural attack prevention
4. **Automatic POLA Enforcement** (2.4): Type system-enforced least privilege

These theorems provide mathematical guarantees for secure, scalable, and
composable microkernel architecture with direct implementation correspondence in
Rust.
