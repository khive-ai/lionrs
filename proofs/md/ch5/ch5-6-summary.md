This chapter completed the formal verification framework for the Lion ecosystem
by establishing end-to-end correctness through integration of all
component-level guarantees. We proved policy evaluation correctness with
soundness, completeness, and decidability properties, demonstrated guaranteed
workflow termination with bounded resource consumption, and established
system-wide invariant preservation across all component interactions.

## Main Achievements

### Theorem 5.1: Policy Evaluation Correctness

We established comprehensive correctness for Lion's policy evaluation system:

$$\forall p \in \text{Policies}, \forall a \in \text{Actions}, \forall c \in \text{Capabilities}:$$

1. **Soundness**:
   $\varphi(p,a,c) = \text{PERMIT} \Rightarrow \text{safe}(p,a,c)$
2. **Completeness**:
   $\text{safe}(p,a,c) \Rightarrow \varphi(p,a,c) \neq \text{DENY}$
3. **Decidability**: $O(d \times b)$ complexity where $d$ = depth, $b$ =
   branching factor

**Key Contributions**:

- Extended Chapter 4's policy soundness to include capability integration
- Proved completeness ensuring safe accesses aren't inappropriately denied
- Established polynomial-time decidability for practical deployment
- Integrated three-valued logic semantics with capability verification

### Theorem 5.2: Workflow Termination

We demonstrated guaranteed termination with resource bounds:

$$\forall w \in \text{Workflows}:$$

1. **Termination**: $\text{terminates}(w)$ in finite time
2. **Resource Bounds**:
   $\text{resource\_consumption}(w) \leq \text{declared\_bounds}(w)$
3. **Progress**:
   $\forall \text{step} \in w: \text{eventually}(\text{completed}(\text{step}) \lor \text{failed}(\text{step}))$

**Key Extensions**:

- Enhanced Chapter 4's DAG termination with resource consumption guarantees
- Integrated actor model deadlock freedom for per-step progress
- Established bounded retry policies preventing infinite error loops
- Connected workflow execution to Lion's verified concurrency model

## End-to-End Correctness Integration

### System-Wide Invariant Preservation

We established the global security invariant:

$$\text{SystemInvariant}(s) \triangleq \bigwedge \begin{cases}
\text{MemoryIsolation}(s) & \text{(Chapter 3, Theorem 3.1)} \\
\text{DeadlockFreedom}(s) & \text{(Chapter 3, Theorem 3.2)} \\
\text{CapabilityConfinement}(s) & \text{(Chapter 2, Theorems 2.1-2.4)} \\
\text{PolicyCompliance}(s) & \text{(Chapter 4, Theorem 4.1)} \\
\text{WorkflowTermination}(s) & \text{(Chapter 4/5, Theorems 4.2/5.2)} \\
\text{ResourceBounds}(s) & \text{(Integrated across chapters)}
\end{cases}$$

**Theorem 5.3** (System-Wide Invariant Preservation):
$\forall s, \sigma: \text{SystemInvariant}(s) \Rightarrow \text{SystemInvariant}(\text{execute}(s, \sigma))$

### Cross-Component Interaction Correctness

We verified all component interaction protocols:

- Capability Manager ↔ Policy Engine: Only authorized capabilities granted
- Isolation Enforcer ↔ Plugins: Memory boundaries strictly enforced
- Workflow Manager ↔ Actor System: Deadlock-free task coordination
- Policy Engine ↔ All Components: Sound authorization decisions

### Attack Vector Coverage

**Theorem 5.6** (Attack Coverage): Every identified attack vector is covered by
at least one verified mitigation:

| Attack Class         | Mitigation             | Verification       |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| Memory-based attacks | WebAssembly isolation  | Theorem 3.1        |
| Privilege escalation | Capability confinement | Chapter 2 theorems |
| Policy bypass        | Policy soundness       | Theorem 5.1        |
| Resource exhaustion  | Bounds enforcement     | Theorem 5.2        |
| Deadlock/livelock    | Actor model            | Theorem 3.2        |
| Composition attacks  | Interface verification | Theorem 5.4        |

## Implementation Roadmap Achievement

### Theory-to-Practice Correspondence

We established comprehensive mapping from formal specifications to
implementation:

2. **TLA+ specifications** for temporal and concurrent properties
3. **Property-based testing** for runtime verification
4. **Static analysis** for code-specification correspondence
5. **Integration testing** for end-to-end system behavior

### Performance Preservation

**Theorem 5.7** (Performance Preservation): Security mechanisms do not
asymptotically degrade performance.

**Evidence**:

- Policy evaluation: $O(d \times b)$ with small constants
- Capability verification: $O(1)$ cryptographic operations
- Memory isolation: ~2-5% WebAssembly overhead
