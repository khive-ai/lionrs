## Mathematical Content Overview

### Theorems Proven

- **Theorem 5.1** (Policy Evaluation Correctness): Sound, complete, and
  decidable policy evaluation with $O(d \times b)$ complexity
- **Theorem 5.2** (Workflow Termination): Guaranteed termination with bounded
  resource consumption and per-step progress

## Chapter Significance

Chapter 5 represents the culmination of the Lion ecosystem formal verification,
demonstrating that:

1. **Mathematical Rigor and Practical Implementation** can be unified in a
   single system
2. **End-to-End Correctness** can be achieved through compositional verification
3. **Formal Methods** can be integrated into modern development processes
4. **Security and Performance** can be optimized simultaneously through formal
   analysis
5. **Future Research** can build on a solid foundation of verified components

This chapter establishes Lion as both a working system and a research platform,
showing that the vision of mathematically verified systems can be realized in
practice while opening new possibilities for advancing the state of the art in
formal verification, systems security, and distributed computing.
